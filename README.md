**Project Classification**: Machine Learning & AI System


**Technology Stack**: Python 3.8+, TensorFlow/Keras, PostgreSQL, REST APIs


**Target Accuracy**: 99%


**Architecture**: Ensemble Deep Learning with Multi-Source Data Integration


**Status**: Skeleton phase Implementation

The following is a Technical explanation of the Hosoptima official Artificial intelligence for HOS compliance prediction project.This project ia currently in progress having started creating the programs on September 1st with expected phases being *Skeleton code*, *Base code*, *Alpha test*, *Beta test*, *Final production*

**Skeleton code**
The skeleton code phase is an introduction of every part of our code before the official data was received. To save on time, we created our codes using synthetic data and close-to assumptions based on other already in production softwares such as Omnion and Samsara.

**Base code**
Phase where we receive official data and API connections and therefore make editorial changes to our codes to fit the production expectations with constant model training and testing. Base accuracy at this point is 80% with constant training,testing and validation to achieve upto 99% accuracy.

**Alpha test**
Phase where we begin internal company testing of our model after assembling the model together with other developers including the frontend and backend developers with constant small changes made to ensure stability of our model. At this point we consider the project 90% complete and 10% incomplete is considered arising issues or changes

**Beta test**
Official model fully complete and has met expectations and is currently being tested with few external trusted partners and investors as we await official production/ release date.
**Final production**

Product is officially released for use into the market based on Companies choice of date.

**Current Update**
*Data_connector module*
